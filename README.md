# Optimizely Next.js Starter Kit

The goal of this repo is to get you to a running NextJS app with Optimizely as fast as possible.

## Prerequisites

To run the application, you need to have the following installed:

- Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- Install extension [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- Docker or Docker Desktop

## Getting Started

To get started with the application, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code and press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) to open the command palette. Type "Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume" and press Enter.
2. Enter the repository address `https://github.com/optimizely/next-js-starter-kit`.
3. If asked, choose the `main` branch.
4. Once the repository is cloned and opened in the dev container, run the project by opening a terminal in Visual Studio Code (press `` Ctrl + `  `` (or `` Cmd + `  `` on macOS) and execute the following command:

   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Click the link to the http://localhost:3000/ address to open a browser to the running Next app and seeing the quick Start information on the home page.

## To Exit

1. Type `Ctrl + C` in the terminal panel where your `npm run dev` was running.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on macOS) to open the command palette.
3. Select the "Remote: Close Remote Connection" command, which will close the project and exit the running container.
